# tadpoles-media-downloader
Hack method to download all of your media from tadpoles.com

***INSTRUCTIONS BELOW***

Quick script I wrote to download all pictures and videos out of tadpoles. To use, do the following:

1.) Copy the following string of text:

javascript:var js = document.createElement('script');js.src = 'https://jwally.github.io/tadpoles-media-downloader/index.js';document.querySelectorAll('head')[0].appendChild(js)

2.) Open google chrome (might work with other browsers, but not really tested)

3.) Log into tadpoles

4.) In the address bar, type the word "javascript" followed by a colon (:) like this:

javascript:

5.) Paste the text you copied earlier so your address bar now looks like this:

javascript:var js = document.createElement('script');js.src = '//bit.ly/36doNsE';document.querySelectorAll('head')[0].appendChild(js)

6.) Hit ENTER

7.) When the website asks for permission to download multiple files, click "YES". These are your pictures and videos its trying to download.

This sounds *WAY* more complicated than it really is.
